Mitochondria are organelles present in most eukaryotic cells that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell. They are double-membraned organelles, with the inner membrane folded into cristae that increase the surface area of the membrane, allowing for more ATP production. Mitochondria also play a role in other cellular processes, such as cell signaling, differentiation, and cell death.
