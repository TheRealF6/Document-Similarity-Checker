Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy currency of the cell 12. Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles, with the inner membrane being folded into cristae that increase the surface area of the membrane, allowing for more ATP production 12. Mitochondria also play a role in other cellular processes, such as cell signaling, differentiation, and cell death 12.
